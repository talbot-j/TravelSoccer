\begin{oddBlock}{Expectations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item - Honesty \& Integrity:  Be honest and follow through on what you say you are going to do or promise.  If you do, nobody will question you and nobody will fault you when outcomes do not turn out as you expected because they will know you did everything you tried to do.
        \item Sportsmanship:  Discuss that this is team sport, there is no individual failure, we win and lose as a team.  Support each other, help each other and the other team to their feet.  If they are offer a quick check, then walk away and take a knee, clap and applaud them when they get up.
        \item Positive Attitudes: Do not spread negativity - it impacts everyone.  You don't need to be happy, but do not bring complaint or give up, stay positive and strive to learn from both good and bad outcomes.
        \item Work Hard: come ready to give it 100\% all the time.  We all have bad days, but you will grow more by giving it your all on a bad day than on a good day.
        \item Listen and Respect: everyone needs to be listening when a coach, the manager or a referee is talking to the team and give your respect to coaches, the team manager, the referee and the fans.  Bad language or attitudes will not be tolerated.
        \item If you care not to abide by these rules, we will practice for the track team - in other words you will be running a lot.
    \end{itemize}
