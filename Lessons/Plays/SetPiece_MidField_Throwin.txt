Designed for a throw in near the midfield third of the pitch. Especially useful against tightly marking defences who aggressively defend the midfield line. Its simple and effective for players of almost any age. This play involves 3 players. The two possible receivers of the ball simply switch position, but in such a way as to screen the defenders.

Full Back A is in position for the throw in. B is up field as far as possible for a quick throw. (No more than 20 yards). Player C is square with A about 10 yards of the sideline. B starts the play by 'showing' or running to A for the ball. Player C immediately sprints, passing just in front of B. This will briefly screen the defender. The ball should be delivered between C and the sideline so that the ball can be shielded from the defense.
