        \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
        \item Players start at blue gate
        \item Then dribble the ball through the gates.

        \textbf{Coaching Points:}
        \begin{itemize}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
        \item When first starting, it will help to focus on proper technique over speed.  Increase the speed as the their technique improves.
        \item Technique uses top outside of the foot, toe down, pushing the ball forward 2 or 3 steps.
        \item Set width of of the gate based on skill.
