%\begin{evenBlock}{Gate Dribbling (10 min)}
%Set up 3 gates in a zig-zag pattern about 6 to 10 yards apart.  The gates should be about a yard wide or less depending on dribbling skill of the group.  Players start a the end line and dribble through the gates as fast as possible.  Use the same technique as the previous drill.

        \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
        \item Focus on quickly getting to speed then slowing down.
        \item Focus on using small quicks touches around the cone, keeping it tight.
        \item Stay low and use your bend legs to explode away,
        \item Then compress them to slow down.
        \item Finish strong by sprinting right through the last gate, jogging back to the next blue gate.
