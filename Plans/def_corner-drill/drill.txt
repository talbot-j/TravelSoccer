Game situation
The two teams must play a small-sided game. The following rules apply:

If a goal is scored, the team scoring the goal is also awarded a corner kick.
If a defending team manages to clear a corner and then counter attack to score, then they are awarded two goals.
Place a ball in each corner just off the pitch and award a corner rather than a throw-in if the ball leaves play in the opponent’s half of the field.
These rules ensure teams have repetition of defending corners in a game situation.
