Passing and Striking

Note, we have not formally talked about how to properly strike the ball for power, that will be coming up in a few practices.

Hi Parents,

I plan to send out some overview emails every few weeks to review 
Saturday's practice was all about passing.

First Touch and Open Body Position:    The first drill focused on proper passing technique and our first touch.  The goal of the drill was to make a accurate pass to our partner player and for that partner player use one touch to control the ball within a small box.  If a bad pass was made the player receiving the pass would need to shuffle his feet quickly into a position so that his first touch still places the ball in the box.  The second touch would pass it back.  In a few weeks we will revisit this and make a stronger emphasis on using only 2 touches.

The next drill, continued to focus on passing but also introduced the proper body position when receiving a pass - which to is remain "open".  The goal was to use the proper foot, depending on the direction of the pass to trap and then pass to the next player on the next touch.  In a few weeks we will revisit this same drill and if they are ready add a movement element.  But before we make it harder the passes need to be stronger, and more accurate, especially with their weak foot.

It clear that we have a lot of work to do when it comes to the weak foot - this is VERY common at this age.  To build competence with our weak foot we will continue to use both feet in all drills.  Please encourage the boys to use their weak foot 50% or more during their practice time at home.  We will be a much stronger team if we can feel comfortable using both feet.
