P01: Introduction Day....
	Introductions: 10 min
		- discuss expectations: 
			- honesty & integrity:  Be honest and follow through on what you say you are going to do or promise.  If you do, nobody will question you and nobody will fault you when outcomes do not turn out as you expected because they will know you did everything you tried to do.
			- sportsmanship:  Discuss that this is team sport, there is no individual failure, we win and lose as a team.  Support each other, help each other and the other team to their feet.  If they are offer a quick check, then walk away and take a knee, clap and applaud them when they get up.
			- positive attitudes: Do not spread negativity - it impacts everyone.  You don't need to be happy, but do not bring complaint or give up, stay positive and strive to learn from both good and bad outcomes.
			- work hard: come ready to give it 100% all the time.  We all have bad days, but you will grow more by giving it your all on a bad day than on a good day.
			- listen and respect: everyone needs to be listening when a coach, the manager or a referee is talking to the team and give your respect to coaches, the team manager, the referee and the fans.  Bad language or attitudes will not be tolerated.
			- If you care not to abide by these rules, we will practice for the track team - in other words you will be running a lot.
		- Captains: discuss the captain role and how it is shared.  I hold captains responsible for the team so if your captain be sure you help insure the team focuses and follows the rules.  If you fail at your duty from the lack of effort, you may find yourself running extra.  If you tried but the team failed to give you respect - they will find themselves running extra as you drink cool water cheering them on.
		- Discuss practice expectations:
			- bring water bottle(s), cleats, ball and shin guards.
			- no sun glasses, hats, hoods or jewelry.
			- practice will always start with warm ups (included touches),
			- then move on to drills,
			- may include a small sided game or scrimmage,
			- followed by sprints or some form of conditioning routine.

	Warm-ups - go over the warm-up routine. 10 min

	Introduce Coerver Touches -  20 min  Discuss the homeworks each player is required to do.

	Ask about positions: 5 min
		1. desired position,
		2. experience playing a position,
		3. experience with soccer.
	
	Discuss: 5 min
		1. Rules changes for U11: No retreat and punts are allowed.
		2. Positional names and formations.
		3. Introduce the 1-3-2-3 formation and the 1-4-3-1 formation.
		4. Offsides - explain there is no offsides on corner kicks goals kicks or throw-ins.  Also no offsides on our half of the field - rare.
	
	Role-Play some game situations: 20 min
		1. Focus on moving to open, reachable spaces without the ball,
		2. Focus on insuring the player with the ball has 2 or more passing options.
		3. When on own half - keep ball to the outside, and push down the side lines.
			If someone is open in the center arc you can pass there.
		4. Passing backward is frowned upon for a few reasons:
			- if the team was advancing down the field, we now must back petal to support the reachable passing needed,
			- the backward pass needs to be perfect and handled perfect, a bad pass or a mishandled pass gives advantage to the opposing team can easily result in a score by them.  We are essentially playing against ourselves.
		5. use the sideline to our advantage - if passing the ball down field to a player in the correct position will result in then handling inbounds or possibly the other team kicking it out - result we get a throw in that much closer to their goal, we maintain the advantage.
		6. if passed to the center shoot or pass to the outside for a cross back to the middle.

		a.) Pass from keeper to outside def, 
		b.) down to mid field,
